# Simon-Game üñ•Ô∏è
The game is a memory challenge where the computer generates a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons. Each time the player gets the sequence correct, it becomes one step longer. If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends, and they can press any key to restart. The goal is to repeat the growing sequence without making mistakes.
